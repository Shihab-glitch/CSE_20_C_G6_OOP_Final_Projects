## 💻 Prerequisites

To compile and run these projects, you need:

- **C++ Compiler:** GCC (g++) version 7.0 or higher, or any C++11 compatible compiler
- **Operating System:** Windows, Linux, or macOS
- **Basic knowledge:** Understanding of C++ and OOP concepts

## 🔧 How to Compile and Run

### Using g++ (Linux/macOS/Windows with MinGW)

1. Navigate to the project directory:
```bash
cd /path/to/CSE_20_C_G6_OOP_Final_Projects
```

2. Compile any project using g++:
```bash
g++ -o output_name project_file.cpp
```

**Example:**
```bash
g++ -o student_system 1119015_Student_Management_System.cpp
```

3. Run the compiled program:
```bash
./output_name          # Linux/macOS
output_name.exe        # Windows
```

**Example:**
```bash
./student_system       # Linux/macOS
student_system.exe     # Windows
```

### Using Online Compilers

Alternatively, you can copy the code and run it on online C++ compilers such as:
- [OnlineGDB](https://www.onlinegdb.com/online_c++_compiler)
- [Replit](https://replit.com/)
- [Programiz Online Compiler](https://www.programiz.com/cpp-programming/online-compiler/)

## 🎯 OOP Concepts Demonstrated

Each project in this repository demonstrates one or more of the following OOP principles:

- **Encapsulation:** Data hiding and bundling of data with methods
- **Inheritance:** Creating derived classes from base classes
- **Polymorphism:** Method overriding and virtual functions
- **Abstraction:** Abstract classes and pure virtual functions
- **File Handling:** Persistent data storage and retrieval
- **Data Structures:** Use of arrays, vectors, and custom data structures
